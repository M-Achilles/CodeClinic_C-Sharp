 # Project 1: Barometer
 ## Tasks
 * Input of barometric data from datasoure
    * Example textfile for first implementation
    * Later data from an API or something
* Create a function that gets a start date, end date and the data passed in and returns cartesian coordinates
* Create a function that calculates the slope of barometric pressure of the given timerange 
* Plot the graph with a technologie of your choice
    * UWP
    * Xamarin.Forms
    * ASP.&#8203;net

# Project 2: Where Am I?
## Task
* Find the geolocation of the machine, currently running your code
    * Show
